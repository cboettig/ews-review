Introduction
============

Many natural systems exhibit regime shifts - rapid changes in the state and
conditions of system behavior. Such shifts include lake eutrophication
(Carpenter et al. 1999), algal overgrowth of coral systems (Mumby et al. 2007),
fishery collapse (Jackson et al. 2001), desertification of grasslands (Kéfi et
al. 2007), and rapid changes in climate (Dakos et al. 2008). Such drastic shifts
have the potential to impact ecosystem health and human well-being. Thus, it is
important to develop strategies for adaptation, mitigation, and avoidance of
such shifts.

The idea that complex systems such as ecosystems could change suddenly and
without warning goes back to the 1970s (Holling 1973, May 1977). Such early work
revealed that even simple models with the appropriate nonlinearities were
capable of unpredictable behavior. The only way to predict the transition was to
have the right model -- and that meant having already had the chance to observe
the transition (even then this remains a tough problem).

An important component of this management challenge is the development of early
warning signals (EWS) of impending rapid regime shifts (Scheffer et al. 2009).
Since regime shifts occur in a variety of systems, and underlying mechanisms for
the shifts are not always known, *generic* signals applicable to a variety of
systems will be particularly valuable.

Lack of Generality of Critical Slowing Down
-------------------------------------------

Critical slowing down (CSD) has been studied extensively in theoretical (Wissel
1984, Gandhi et al. 1998, Carpenter et al. 2006, Hastings and Wysham 2010, Dakos
et al. 2011a, Lade and Gross 2012, Boettiger and Hastings 2012a) and empirical
contexts (Drake and Griffen 2010, Veraart et al. 2011, Carpenter 2011, Dai et
al. 2012, Wang et al. 2012) as a potential EWS. CSD occurs as a system's
dominant eigenvalue approaches zero due to a changing (possibly deteriorating)
environment. As the eigenvalue approaches zero, the system's response to small
perturbations slows. This change in dynamic properties of a system can be
expressed in greater variance, autocorrelation, and return time of observed
state variables.

The fact that critical slowing down can be observed in advance of sudden
transitions across a range of otherwise unrelated phenomena -- climate states,
brain waves, and food webs -- can give the illusion of a general theory:

> Perhaps the most exciting aspect of this work is that it is uncovering generic
> features that should in principle hold for any complex system. This implies
> that we may use these approaches even if we do not understand all details of
> the underlying mechanisms that drive any particular system. (Scheffer et al.
> 2012)

Care is needed to avoid the fallacy that "all A are B" because we have observed
that "some A are B". While more examples emerge of systems that exhibit the
anticipated patterns of critical slowing down before sudden transitions, we do
well not to miss the examples of systems that show the same pattern without a
transition, or a sudden transition preceded by a very different pattern.

While it is usually recalled that some abrubt transitions are not be preceded by
critical slowing down

> Not all abrupt transitions will be preceded by slowing down. For instance,
> sharp change may simply result from a sudden big external impact. (Scheffer et
> al. 2012)

While large external forcing is frequently given as the simplest example of how
a transtion could occur without any warning (Scheffer et al. 2001, 2009,
Barnosky et al. 2012, Scheffer et al. 2012), it is by no means the only
mechanism.

Here we review a variety of mechanisms that may lead to rapid (or
"catastrophic") regime shifts in ecological systems, as well as mechanisms that
generate observations of CSD. We illustrate that these phenomena do not overlap
in many cases. We then discuss the conditions under which CSD and other warning
signals may be reliably used, and the supporting evidence neccessary to
establish whether they are appropriate to specific contexts.

Relationships between Regime Shifts, Bifurcations, and CSD
==========================================================

In Figure 1 we illustrate the domains of overlap between three distinct stes of
phenomena. The first, *rapid regime shifts* are abrupt changes in system
behavior. The second, *bifurcations* are qualitative changes in system behavior
due to the passing of a threshold in underlying parameters or conditions. Where
these two overlap, we sometime call the phenomenon a "catastrophic bifurcation."
Finally, *critical slowing down* is the observed behavior of slow system
response to perturbation. The labels in italics describe examples of phenomena
that fall into these various domains. Below we describe cases that fall into
each of these regions.

![Figure 1: Venn diagram repesenting the intersecting domains of rapid regime
shifts, bifurcations, and critical slowing down. Text in italic are example
phenomena that occur in each domain.]

Catastrophic Bifurcations Preceded by CSD
-----------------------------------------

Much of the (most visible) recent research in early warning signals has focused
on the center of the diagram, where all three concepts intersect. The warning
signal patterns postulated, such as increasing variance and coefficient of
variation, (Carpenter et al. 2006), increasing autocorrelation (Dakos et al.
2008), increasing skewness (Guttal and Jayaprakash 2008a) can all be directly
derived from the changing eigenvalue in a saddle node bifurcation. Consequently,
experimential evaluations of warning signals have largely focused on this
situation as well. CSD has frequently been studied in the context of models
exhibiting a saddle-node bifurcation [Figure 1: Equilibrium Diagram of Saddle
Node] (Barnosky et al. 2012). Saddle-nodes are one of many potential
bifurcations in ecological systems, though. Rapid regime shifts may also occur
in the absence of bifurcations at all.

Dai et al. (2012) clearly maps out the entire saddle-node bifurcation diagram
emprically before presenting the corresponding decrease in recovery time
(increase in variance and autocorrelation over time). Veraart et al. (2011)
shows a very similar result in a similar system. These important experiments are
among the best demonstrations that saddle-node bifurcation dynamics really occur
in natural systems, and can be accompanied by reliable detection of early
warning signals, at least when sufficient data sampling, replicates, and
controls are available.

Carpenter et al. (2011) provides an even more ambitious example, in which a lake
ecosystem is manipulated towards a sudden transition through the introduction of
a predator, while a neighboring experimental lake provides a control. In this
example the underlying dynamics of a whole lake ecosystem are far less tractable
than the laboratory controlled chemoststats of microrganisms. While it is more
difficult to identify the bifurcation process, the system is understood well
enough to anticipate that a sudden transition can be induced under the intended
manipulation. Like the laboratory examples, this helps eliminate the options
outside the circle "bifurcations", in Figure 1. The observed warning signals
then place it in the center.

Catastrophic Bifurcations *not* Preceded by CSD
-----------------------------------------------

**OPEN QUESTON: Should we bother reproducing some of the figures from other
papers?**

Saddle nodes are only one of a variety of bifurcations which can cause rapid
changes in system dynamics. Other bifurcations can cause long-term changes in
system dynamics without a gradual pass through a state with zero eigenvalue, and
therefore, not exhibit CSD.

These are some of the most problematic cases, because they represent disruptive
but potentially avoidable events, but would not be detected by using CSD as an
early warning signals.

One class of bifurcations in which we would not expect to see CSD prior to
regime shift are sometimes known as *crises*. Crises are sudden changes in the
dynamics of chaotic attractors that occur in response to small changes in
parameters (Grebogi et al. 1983). Chaotic attractors are features of many
ecological models (Hastings et al. 1993), and chaotic behavior has been shown in
some ecological systems [@Constantino1997]

Hastings and Wysham (2010) examined a continuous model of a stochastic
three-species food chain where all species migrate between six patches. When
environemental stochasticity (represented as random variation in the carrying
capacity) is low, all species coexist in a chaotic but stable attractor. A small
increase in environmental stochasticity, though, causes extinction of the top
predator and and rapid shift to a non-chaotic cycle. Despite an increase in
environmental variability, neither the variance nor skew of the populations of
any species change as the system approaches this bifurcation

Another example of a chaotic crisis can be found in a simple discrete-time model
where a population is subject to strong density dependence (an Allee effect) and
harvested by predatirs with a Type II (saturating) functional response
(Schreiber 2003). When prey have high growth rates, the system has chaotic
dynamics. Small increases in the predation intensity cause a bifurcation with
chaotic but persistent prey populations to prey extinction. As predation
intensity increases towards this threshold, the population exhibits *decreasing*
variance.

**OPEN QUESTION: Should we simulate this to see what the autocorrelation/skew
look like?**

Some spatially extended systems exhibit a type of bifurcation which is not
accompanied by CSD. In one class of models, individual locations are subject to
saddle node-type regime shifts, and also influence adjacent locations via
short-range facilitation and long-range competition. Such models are used
represent transitions between vegetation types in response to changing water
availability, and reproduce naturally occurring vegetation patterns (Rietkerk
and van de Koppel 2008). In such systems, a regime shift in one location can
propogate spatially and transition the whole system from one regime to another.
Such a transition occurs if the control parameter (e.g., rainfall), exceeds the
*Maxwell point* - the value at which a local disturbance propogates outwards
(Bel et al. 2012). The Maxwell point may be far from the level at which an
individual location would undergo a saddle-node bifurcation, and thus the
system's global dynamics would not exhibit CSD prior to such a transition.

Non-Catastrophic Bifurcations Preceded by CSD
---------------------------------------------

Not all regime shifts are rapid. Some systems undergo bifurcations between
qualitatively different, but quantatively similar regimes. These transitions may
be reversible. In a management setting, such qualitative changes may
insignificant, so warning signals which detect such transitions may be effective
"false positives".

CSD precedes several types of these non-catastrophic bifurcations. In the
subcritical form of a Hopf bifurcation, a system transitions from a stable
equilibrium to a stable cycle. This bifurcation occurs in classical
predator-prey systems (May 1972) and has been observed in experimental systems
[**ADD REFS**]. As a control parameter approaches the critical threshold, the
system's dominant eigenvalue approaches zero and thus exhibits CSD (Chisholm and
Filotas 2009, Kéfi et al. 2012). However, the mean value of the equilibrium does
not change dramatically, and the transition from stable equilibrium to cycles is
gradual as the cycle sizes grow from zero at the threshold value. In the
presence of stochasticity, system behavior may be observed on either side of the
threshold may be indistinguishable.

The system's eigenvalue also passes through zero in the case of the
transcritical bifurcation. The transcritical is a degenerate case of the the
saddle-node, and occurs in many of the same systems. However, when a system
passes through a transcritical bifurcation, the stable equilibrium transitions
smoothly from positive to zero, or the reverse. In population systems, this
corresponds to a transition from a very small population size to extinction - an
important but non-catastrophic, and probably directly observable, event. CSD is
observed prior to the transcritical bifurcations (Chisholm and Filotas 2009,
Kéfi et al. 2012).

An experimental example a transcritical bifurcation found in Drake and Griffen
(2010), where the a population of *Daphnia* were forced through a transcritical
bifurcation by reducing food supplies and driving population growth rates below
zero. Indicators of CSD (variation, skewness, autocorrelation, and spatial
correlation) increased prior to collapse of the population.

Non-Catastrophic Bifurcations without CSD
-----------------------------------------

**TODO: Anything here? Beyond a trivial change from positive to zero
population**

Catastrophic Regime Shifts without CSD
--------------------------------------

**TODO: More examples here? This is obvious in some ways, but showing ubiquity
may be useful**

Some rapid regime shifts are not due to bifurcations at all. A system may
undergo a because of a rapid change in external conditions, an external
disturbance or internal stochastic event that switches it between dynamic
regimes. In neither case would CSD be expected to precede such changes.

**TODO: Insert figure like Bel et al. (2012) Fig. 1?**

![From Bel et al. (2012): Difference between different types of perturbations]

Large, rapid changes in external conditions will result in rapid changes in
ecological system dynamics. For instance, rapid changes in North American
vegetation at the start of the Bølling-Allerød and end of the Younger Dryas
period are thought to be responses to similarly large, rapid changes in climate
(Williams et al. 2011).

Stochastic perturbations may shift systems from one regime to another even if
underlying environmental conditions remain the same. Hastings and Wysham (2010)
showed that in a model where one species with stochastic Ricker dynamics
disperses among eight patches, model behavior can switch stochastically between
wildly oscillatory behavior and regularly cycling regimes even while parameters
(including stochastic variability) remain the same.

Schooler et al. (2011) found that lakes with the invasive plant *Salvaniai
molesta* and herbivorous weevils alternated between low- and high-*Salvnia*
states driven by external disturbances from regular flooding events. Ditlevsen
and Johnsen (2010) examined 25 abruptclimate changes that occurred during the
last glacial period (Dansgaard‐Oeschger events) and found no evidence for CSD in
high-resolution climate data from ice cores, and concluded that the events were
driven by endogenous climate stochasticity.

Some events that appear to be regime shifts may actually be transients in some
systems. Sudden changes in dynamics can occur in simple ecological models with
strong density dependence that take long times to reach equilibrium. Hastings
and Higgins (1994) showed such dynamics in model of dispersal of iter- or
sub-tidal organisms whose larvae disperse along a coastline. Over the thousands
of years it takes the model to reach equilibrium, it may alternate between
temporary regimes of regular cycles and chaos which switch in only a few years.
While on long time scales these are technically not regime shifts, such changes
would effectively appear to be regime shifts on shorter ones. We would not
expect such regime shifts to be preceded with CSD.

Other Catstrophic Regime Shifts with CSD
----------------------------------------

**TODO: Expand**

-   Could CSD occur in any type of regime shift that are not due to
    bifurcations?
-   CSD may be observed prior to stochastically-driven regime shifts due to a
    stochastic artifact (See "Statistical Power" below, and Boettiger and
    Hastings (2012a)).
-   CSD may also be observed in systems when they are *coupled* with other
    systems undergoing saddle-node bifurcations.

CSD in the absence of regime shifts
-----------------------------------

**TODO: Expand**

-   Systems undergoing change can exhibit CSD even in the absence of a rapid
    regime shift of bifurcation (Kéfi et al. 2012)

Observed vs. Real CSD - Statistical Power
=========================================

-   Even in cases where CSD precedes a rapid regime shift, *detection* of CSD
    may be imperfect. *Observed* CSD can only be used as an indicator if it can
    be detected and rejected reliably, which is often not the case under common
    levels of noise in ecological data (Perretti and Munch 2012).
-   Need to know the power of CSD detection methods
-   Model-based approaches are more powerful than summary statistics (Boettiger
    and Hastings 2012a)
-   Reciever-operator are a useful method for evaluating the efficacy of warning
    signals (Boettiger and Hastings 2012a)
-   Comparative, experimental studies
    -   Historical data introduces biases (Boettiger and Hastings 2012a)

Implications
============

-   While saddle-node transitions are common, they represent only part of the
    potential mechanisms for rapid regime shift.

-   CSD can't be used alone as evidence regime shift. In some cases, it will be
    a false signal. In other cases, regime shifts occur without CSD. Additional
    information needed in order to determine best signal to use.

-   For stochastically-driven regime shifts, prediction may not be possible.
    Managing for resilience [refs] may be the only option.

-   Regime shifts driven by external perturbation or strong forcing are not
    predictable *if the scope of mangement does not include the external
    causes*. Proper scoping of the management problem can avoid this situation.

Context-specific signals
------------------------

-   Need to establish that you are in a warning signals' domain of applicability
    in order to use it
-   In this domain, the warning signal should have reasonable power to
    distinguish between real and false cases
-   Potential ways to establish this
    -   Known mechanistic model
    -   Manipulated system.
    -   Fitting models to past regime shift data, but models that serve as tests
        between saddle node transitions and transitions caused by other
        mechanisms.

-   Examples: Saddle nodes
    -   Much research on regime shifts and early warning signals has focused on
        lakes (Refs from Scheffer et al. 2001), which are well-modeled
    -   Veraart et al. (2011) and Dai et al. (2012) studied simple experimental
        systems which could be described with simple mechanistic models, and in
        which saddle-nodes bifurcations could be inferred both theoretically and
        experimentally.
    -   Forest/savanna transition has supporting evidence, e.g. Bel et al.
        (2012), Staver et al. (2011), Hirota et al. (2011)

-   Evidence supporting the potential of other mechanisms
    -   Strong density dependence make chaos, and thus both crises and chaotic
        transients, more likely (Wysham and Hastings 2008).

Examining other signals for their domains of applicability

-   Flickering (Brock and Carpenter 2010, Wang et al. 2012)

    et al. (2007), Kefi et al. (2008) and van Nes and Scheffer (2005))
-   Network-theory based observations (Scheffer et al. 2012)
