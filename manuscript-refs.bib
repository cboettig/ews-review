  abstract	= {Understanding the behaviour of complex environmental
		  systems, particularly as critical thresholds are
		  approached, is vitally important in many contexts. Among
		  these are the moisture-limited vegetation systems in
		  semi-arid (SA) regions of the World, which support
		  approximately 36 per cent of the human population, maintain
		  considerable biodiversity and which are susceptible to
		  rapid stress-induced collapse. Change in spatially
		  self-organized vegetation patterning has previously been
		  proposed as a means of identifying approaching thresholds
		  in these systems. In this paper, a newly developed cellular
		  automata model is used to explore spatial patterning and
		  also the temporal dynamics of SA vegetation cover. Results
		  show, for the first time, to my knowledge, in a cellular
		  automata model, that 'critical slowdown' (a pronounced
		  reduction in post-perturbation recovery rates) provides
		  clear signals of system fragility as major thresholds are
		  approached. A consequence of slowing recovery rates is the
		  appearance of quasi-stable population states and increased
		  potential for perturbation-induced multi-staged population
		  collapse. The model also predicts a non-patterned cover
		  where environmental stress levels are high, or where more
		  moderate stress levels are accompanied by frequent
		  perturbations. In the context of changing climatic and
		  environmental pressures, these results provide observable
		  indicators of fragility and threshold proximity in SA
		  vegetation systems that have direct relevance to management
		  policies.},

  abstract	= {Transitions in ecological systems often occur without
		  apparent warning, and may represent shifts between
		  alternative persistent states. Decreasing ecological
		  resilience (the size of the basin of attraction around a
		  stable state) can signal an impending transition, but this
		  effect is difficult to measure in practice. Recent research
		  has suggested that a decreasing rate of recovery from small
		  perturbations (critical slowing down) is a good indicator
		  of ecological resilience. Here we use analytical techniques
		  to draw general conclusions about the conditions under
		  which critical slowing down provides an early indicator of
		  transitions in two-species predator-prey and competition
		  models. The models exhibit three types of transition: the
		  predator-prey model has a Hopf bifurcation and a
		  transcritical bifurcation, and the competition model has
		  two saddle-node bifurcations (in which case the system
		  exhibits hysteresis) or two transcritical bifurcations,
		  depending on the parameterisation. We find that critical
		  slowing down is an earlier indicator of the Hopf
		  bifurcation in predator-prey models in which prey are
		  regulated by predation rather than by intrinsic
		  density-dependent effects and an earlier indicator of
		  transitions in competition models in which the dynamics of
		  the rare species operate on slower timescales than the
		  dynamics of the common species. These results lead directly
		  to predictions for more complex multi-species systems,
		  which can be tested using simulation models or real

  abstract	= {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable

		  abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system
		  reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains

		  Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and

		  actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased
		  autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a
		  hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply
		  independent empirical evidence for the idea that past

		  thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is
		  fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that

  abstract	= {Abstract Predicting the risk of critical transitions, such
		  as the collapse of a population, is important in order to
		  direct management efforts. In any system that is close to a
		  critical transition, recovery upon small perturbations
		  becomes slow, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down.
		  It has been suggested that such slowing down may be
		  detected indirectly through an increase in spatial and
		  temporal correlation and variance. Here, we tested this
		  idea in arid ecosystems, where vegetation may collapse to
		  desert as a result of increasing water limitation. We used
		  three models that describe desertification but differ in
		  the spatial vegetation patterns they produce. In all
		  models, recovery rate upon perturbation decreased before
		  vegetation collapsed. However, in one of the models,
		  slowing down failed to translate into rising variance and
		  correlation. This is caused by the regular self-organized
		  vegetation patterns produced by this model. This finding
		  implies an important limitation of variance and correlation
		  as indicators of critical transitions. However, changes in
		  such self-organized patterns themselves are a reliable
		  indicator of an upcoming transition. Our results illustrate
		  that while critical slowing down may be a universal
		  phenomenon at critical transitions, its detection through
		  indirect indicators may have limitations in particular
		  systems.},

		  are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic
		  changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial
		  ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation
		  patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent
		  transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness
		  changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing
		  pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach.
		  In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to
		  even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation
		  patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid
		  Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we
		  found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation
		  follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton
		  model, we show that local positive interactions among
		  plants can explain such power-law distributions.
		  Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field
		  data revealed consistent deviations from power laws.
		  Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in
		  the model. When grazing was further increased in the model,
		  we found that these deviations always and only occurred
		  close to transition to desert, independent of the type of

		  Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be

  abstract	= {The deteriorating health of the world's coral reefs
		  threatens global biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the
		  livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical
		  coastal regions. Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most
		  heavily affected, having experienced mass disease-induced
		  mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum in
		  1983 and two framework-building species of coral. Declining
		  reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A
		  critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom
		  on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this
		  question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are
		  an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the
		  readily reversible result of a phase change along a
		  gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter.
		  Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in
		  combination with a simple analytical model, we show that
		  Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable
		  states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the
		  majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic
		  hysteresis in a natural system and define critical
		  thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which
		  resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the
		  upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting
		  that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation.
		  Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models
		  of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of
		  ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by
		  estimating the relationship between current reef state
		  (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef
		  will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades
		  without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable
		  macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef
		  managers face the challenge of addressing global
		  disturbance at local scales.},

		  tree cover and fire distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, and
		  (b) a model, based on empirical results, demonstrating that
		  savanna and forest may be alternative stable states in
		  parts of Africa, with implications for understanding
		  savanna distributions. Tree cover does not increase
		  continuously with rainfall, but rather is constrained to
		  low (<50\%, "savanna") or high tree cover (>75\%,
		  "forest"). Intermediate tree cover rarely occurs. Fire,
		  which prevents trees from establishing, differentiates high

		  rainfall (<1000 mm), where rainfall limits tree cover, and
		  at high rainfall (>2000 mm), where fire is rare. This
		  pattern suggests that complex interactions between climate
		  and disturbance produce emergent alternative states in tree
		  cover. The relationship between tree cover and fire was
		  incorporated into a dynamic model including grass, savanna
		  tree saplings, and savanna trees. Only recruitment from
		  sapling to adult tree varied depending on the amount of

		  less, producing a sigmoidal fire probability distribution
		  as a function of grass cover and therefore a sigmoidal
		  sapling to tree recruitment function. This model
		  demonstrates that, given relatively conservative and
		  empirically supported assumptions about the establishment
		  of trees in savannas, alternative stable states for the
		  same set of environmental conditions (i.e., model
		  parameters) are possible via a fire feedback mechanism.

		  Studies of mathematical and experimental systems have shown
		  that systems may 'wobble' before a critical transition.
		  Such early warning signals may be due to the phenomenon of
		  critical slowing down, which causes a system to recover
		  slowly from small impacts, or to a flickering phenomenon,
		  which causes a system to switch back and forth between
		  alternative states in response to relatively large impacts.
		  Such signals for transitions in social-ecological systems
		  have rarely been observed, not the least because
		  high-resolution time series are normally required. Here we
		  combine empirical data from a lake-catchment system with a
		  mathematical model and show that flickering can be detected
		  from sparse data. We show how rising variance coupled to
		  decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started 10-30 years
		  before the transition to eutrophic lake conditions in both
		  the empirical records and the model output, a finding that
		  is consistent with flickering rather than critical slowing
		  down. Our results suggest that if environmental regimes are
		  sufficiently affected by large external impacts that
		  flickering is induced, then early warning signals of
		  transitions in modern social-ecological systems may be
		  stronger, and hence easier to identify, than previously

		  versus endogenous forces producing regime shifts is an
		  important question. These forces' role in generating
		  variability over time in ecological systems has been
		  explored using tools from dynamical systems. We use similar
		  ideas to look at transients in simple ecological models as
		  a way of understanding regime shifts. Based in part on the
		  theory of crises, we carefully analyze a simple two patch
		  spatial model and begin to understand from a mathematical
		  point of view what produces transient behavior in
		  ecological systems. In particular, since the tools are
		  essentially qualitative, we are able to suggest that
		  transient behavior should be ubiquitous in systems with
		  overcompensatory local dynamics, and thus should be typical
		  of many ecological systems.},
