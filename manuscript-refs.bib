@Article{	  Chisholm2009,
  abstract	= {Transitions in ecological systems often occur without
		  apparent warning, and may represent shifts between
		  alternative persistent states. Decreasing ecological
		  resilience (the size of the basin of attraction around a
		  stable state) can signal an impending transition, but this
		  effect is difficult to measure in practice. Recent research
		  has suggested that a decreasing rate of recovery from small
		  perturbations (critical slowing down) is a good indicator
		  of ecological resilience. Here we use analytical techniques
		  to draw general conclusions about the conditions under
		  which critical slowing down provides an early indicator of
		  transitions in two-species predator-prey and competition
		  models. The models exhibit three types of transition: the
		  predator-prey model has a Hopf bifurcation and a
		  transcritical bifurcation, and the competition model has
		  two saddle-node bifurcations (in which case the system
		  exhibits hysteresis) or two transcritical bifurcations,
		  depending on the parameterisation. We find that critical
		  slowing down is an earlier indicator of the Hopf
		  bifurcation in predator-prey models in which prey are
		  regulated by predation rather than by intrinsic
		  density-dependent effects and an earlier indicator of
		  transitions in competition models in which the dynamics of
		  the rare species operate on slower timescales than the
		  dynamics of the common species. These results lead directly
		  to predictions for more complex multi-species systems,
		  which can be tested using simulation models or real
		  ecosystems.},

		  important question. These forces' role in generating
		  variability over time in ecological systems has been

		  theory of crises, we carefully analyze a simple two patch
		  spatial model and begin to understand from a mathematical
		  point of view what produces transient behavior in

		  essentially qualitative, we are able to suggest that
		  transient behavior should be ubiquitous in systems with
		  overcompensatory local dynamics, and thus should be typical
