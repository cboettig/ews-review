Tour of the diagram
===================

+ Bifurcation + Rapid Shift + CSD (Saddle node)
-----------------------------------------------

-   Experimental support
-   Microcosm [@Veraart2011, @Dai2012]
-   Large-scale [@Carpenter2011a]

-   Bifurcation + Rapid Shift - CSD => e.g., Chaotic crisis
    --------------------------------------------------------

-   Not all bifurcations are saddle-node types
-   Non-saddle node bifurcations can cause rapid regime shifts, sometimes
    without demonstrating CSD.
-   Examples demonstrated in models:
    -   Chaotic crises
        -   @Hastings2012b examined a continuous model of a three-species food
            chain where all species coexisted in a chaotic but stable attractor.
            In the model, the top predator rapidly goes extinct in response to a
            gradual increase the strength of stochastic noise, or an increase in
            migration rates of individuals between patches. As the simulated
            system approached this bifurcation, however, no increase in the
            variance or skew of populations was detected.
        -   Schreiber2003a examined a discrete-time model of a species subject
            to strong density dependence (an Allee effect) and harvested by a
            predator with a Type II functional response. In this model, the
            population exhibits *decreasing* variance as predation intensity
            increases, until a threshold level where the population goes
            extinct.

    -   Interacting Regime Shifts [@Brock2010]
    -   Spatially extended systems [@Bel2012]
        -   A local regime shift in a spatially extended system can induce a
            global regime shift as the change propogates through the system. The
            global shift can occur when environmental conditions are, on
            average, far away from the threshold that would cause a local regime
            shift. Thus, even if local regime shifts are due to a fold
            bifurcation, global state variables may not exhibit indicators of
            CSD.

-   Bifurcations - Rapid Shifts - CSD => e.g., Extinction
    ------------------------------------------------------

-   Bifurcation - Rapid Shifts + CSD => Hopf, Transcritical
    --------------------------------------------------------

-   Bifurcations + Rapid Shifts - CSD => Forcing, Stochastic Event, Chaotic transient
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Chaotic transients
    -   In spatially structured models with overcompensatory dynamics, long-term
        transients may appear to be regime shifts [@Hastings1994, @Wysham2008]
        (Should transients be a separate section, including @Hughes2012?]

-   Bifurcations - Rapid Shifts + CSD => Smooth transitions
    --------------------------------------------------------

So What
=======

CSD + not rapid shift. Don’t get excited. Rapid shift - CSD. Problem. New
signals?

Context-specific signals? Evidence needed to establish where you are Known
mechanistic model. Manipulated system. Narrow the field of possible options.
Example of a case that is not enough to know, a case that is.

Use all the available data

Statistical power
=================

A problem for everyone (e.g Saddle node case, and other cases). Understanding
when it is worse Understanding what signals/methods have the most power

Conclusions
===========

Semantic confusion
------------------

-   The terms "regime shift", "critical transition", and "bifurcation" are often
    used interchangably. This has been a source of confusion, as concepts
    applicable to one category may not be applicable to another. Here we define
    them as:

    -   **regime shift:** the transition of an ecological (or socio-ecological)
        system from one set of dynamics or average conditions are dominated by
        one set of relationships, to one dominated by another set of
        relationships.
    -   **bifurcation:** a regime shift caused by a parameter passing a
        threshold value
    -   **critical transition:** a bifurcation that causes a rapid change in the
        conditions of the system

(Venn-diagram type figure showing the relationship between these)

Regime shifts need not be critical transitions or bifurcations. They may be slow
transitions between regimes, or they may occur rapidly. *Rapid regime shifts*
may be causes either by a rapid change in external conditions, or an endogenous
stochastic event.

Anticipating and mitigating the effect of rapid regime shifts in ecological
systems is a major research and management goal [@NSF2009], and early warning
signals (EWS) are an important tool. However, the theoretical basis of early
warning signals apply only to a subset of critical transitions.

Here we detail several ways in which the use of early warning signals generate
both false positive and false negative errors. We outline the conditions under
which we expect EWS to succeed, and the evidence needed to establish these
conditions. Finally we examine recent developments in alternative approaches and
extensions that may enable early detection of rapid regime shifts under
different conditions.

It is not simple to distinguish between rapid regime shifts caused by
bifurcation, and those driven by other causes.

Conditions for False Negatives
==============================

A rapid regime shift may occur with no early warning signal when:

1.  The regime shift is due to a large external forcing
2.  The regime shift is due to an endogenous stochastic event

    Mining the historical literature for examples of regime shifts is likely to
    falsely attribute some shifts to bifurcations even though they are
    stochastic [@Boettiger2012]

3.  The the regime shift is caused by a bifurcation which is *not* characterized
    by early warning signals

-   A chaotic crisis [@Hastings2010]
-   A system without smooth potential [@Hastings2010]
-   A bifurcation with decreasing variance near the transition [@Schreiber????]
-   Other complexities
    -   Systems with multiple thresholds [@Brock2010]

An early warning signal

Reasons for False Positives
===========================

1.  Non-critical bifurcations

-   Hopf
-   Transcritical

2.  Non-bifurcating, smooth transitions between regimes

-   @Kefi2012

Statistical Power
=================

Both false positive and false negative results may be due to inadequate
statistical power

Evidence required in order to use early warning signals
=======================================================

Evidence of saddle-node bifurcation
-----------------------------------

-   Much research on regime shifts and early warning signals has focused on
    lakes [Refs from @Scheffer2001].
-   @Veraart2011 and @Dai2012 studied simple experimental systems which could be
    described with simple mechanistic models, and in which saddle-node
    bifurcations could be inferred both theoretically and experimentally.

-   EWS may best be employed in systems where enough information is available to
    infer the possibility of saddle-node transitions, but where data is
    insufficient to estimate critical thresholds with useful precision.

Figure Concepts
===============

-   Things that show alternative stable states (ASS)
-   Things that show critical transitions/bifurcations (CT)
-   Things that show early warning signs (WS)
