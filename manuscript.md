Semantic confusion
------------------

-   The terms "regime shift", "critical transition", and "bifurcation" are often
    used interchangably. This has been a source of confusion, as concepts
    applicable to one category may not be applicable to another. Here we define
    them as:

    -   **regime shift:** the transition of an ecological (or socio-ecological)
        system from one set of dynamics or average conditions are dominated by
        one set of relationships, to one dominated by another set of
        relationships.
    -   **bifurcation:** a regime shift caused by a parameter passing a
        threshold value
    -   **critical transition:** a bifurcation that causes a rapid change in the
        conditions of the system

(Venn-diagram type figure showing the relationship between these)

Regime shifts need not be critical transitions or bifurcations. They may be slow
transitions between regimes, or they may occur rapidly. *Rapid regime shifts*
may be causes either by a rapid change in external conditions, or an endogenous
stochastic event.

Anticipating and mitigating the effect of rapid regime shifts in ecological systems is a major research and management goal [@NSF2009], and early warning signals (EWS) are an important tool.  However, the theoretical basis of early warning signals apply only to a subset of critical transitions.

Here we detail several ways in which the use of early warning signals generate both false positive and false negative errors.  We outline the conditions under which we expect EWS to succeed, and the evidence needed to establish these conditions. Finally we examine recent developments in alternative approaches and extensions that may enable early detection of rapid regime shifts under different conditions.


It is not simple to distinguish between rapid regime shifts caused by
bifurcation, and those driven by other causes.

Conditions for False Negatives
==============================

A rapid regime shift may occur with no early warning signal when:

1.  The regime shift is due to a large external forcing
2.  The regime shift is due to an endogenous stochastic event

    Mining the historical literature for examples of regime shifts is likely to
    falsely attribute some shifts to bifurcations even though they are
    stochastic [@Boettiger2012]

3.  The the regime shift is caused by a bifurcation which is *not* characterized
    by early warning signals

-   A chaotic crisis [@Hastings2010]
-   A system without smooth potential [@Hastings2010]
-   A bifurcation with decreasing variance near the transition [@Schreiber????]
-   Other complexities
    -   Systems with multiple thresholds [@Brock2010]

An early warning signal

Reasons for False Positives
===========================

1.  Non-critical bifurcations

-   Hopf
-   Transcritical

2.  Non-bifurcating, smooth transitions between regimes

-   @Kefi2012

Statistical Power
=================

Both false positive and false negative results may be due to inadequate
statistical power

Evidence required in order to use early warning signals
=======================================================

Evidence of saddle-node bifurcation
-----------------------------------

-   Much research on regime shifts and early warning signals has focused on
    lakes [Refs from @Scheffer2001].
-   @Veraart2011 and @Dai2012 studied simple experimental systems which could be
    described with simple mechanistic models, and in which saddle-node
    bifurcations could be inferred both theoretically and experimentally.

-   EWS may best be employed in systems where enough information is available to
    infer the possibility of saddle-node transitions, but where data is
    insufficient to estimate critical thresholds with useful precision.

Figure Concepts
===============

-   Things that show alternative stable states (ASS)
-   Things that show critical transitions/bifurcations (CT)
-   Things that show early warning signs (WS)
