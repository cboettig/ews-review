## Intro

## Semantic confusion

 - The terms "regime shift", "critical transition", and "bifurcation" are often used interchangably.  This has been a source of confusion, as concepts applicable to one category may not be applicable to another.  Here we define them as:

    - **regime shift:** the transition of an ecological (or socio-ecological) system from one set of dynamics or average conditions are dominated by one set of relationships, to one dominated by another set of relationships.
    - **bifurcation:** a regime shift caused by a parameter passing a threshold value
    - **critical transition:** a bifurcation that causes a rapid change in the conditions of the system

(Venn-diagram type figure showing the relationship between these)

Regime shifts need not be critical transitions or bifurcations.  They may be slow transitions between regimes, or they may occur rapidly.  *Rapid regime shifts* may be causes either by rapid change in external conditions, or an endogenous stochastic event, in addition to a critical transition.

Anticipating and mitigating the effect of rapid regime shifts in ecological systems is a major research and management goal [@NSF2009], and early warning signals (EWS) are an important tool.  However, the theoretical basis of early warning signals apply only to a subset of critical transitions.

Here we detail several ways in which the use of early warning signals generate both false positive and false negative errors.  We outline the conditions under which we expect EWS to succeed, and the evidence needed to establish these conditions. Finally we examine recent developments in alternative approaches and extensions that may enable early detection of rapid regime shifts under different conditions.

# Reasons for False Negatives

A rapid regime shift may occur with no early warning signal when:

1.  The regime shift is due to a large external forcing
2.  The regime shift is due to an endogenous stochastic event
        
    Mining the historical literature for examples of regime shifts is likely to falsely attribute some shifts to bifurcations even though they are stochastic [@Boettiger2012]
    
3.  The the regime shift is caused by a bifurcation which is *not* characterized by early warning signals

  - A chaotic crisis [@Hastings2010]
  - A system without smooth potential [@Hastings2010]
  - A bifurcation with decreasing variance near the transition [@Schreiber????]
  - Other complexities
    - Systems with multiple thresholds [@Brock2010]

An early warning signal 

# Reasons for False Positives

1. Non-critical bifurcations

   - Hopf
   - Transcritical

2. Non-bifurcating, smooth transitions between regimes

   - @Kef2012

     

## False Positives and Negatives due Statistical Power Issues

Both false positive and false negative results may be due to inadequate statistical power

# Evidence required in order to use early warning signals

## Evidence of saddle-node bifurcation

 - Much research on regime shifts and early warning signals has focused on lakes [Refs from @Scheffer2001].
 - @Veraart2011 and @Dai2012 studied simple experimental systems which could be described with simple mechanistic models, and in which saddle-node bifurcations could be inferred both theoretically and experimentally. 

 - EWS may best be employed in systems where enough information is available to infer the possibility of saddle-node transitions, but where data is insufficient to estimate critical thresholds with useful precision.
 
## Alternative approaches

# Figure Concepts

- Things that show alternative stable states (ASS)
- Things that show critical transitions/bifurcations (CT)
- Things that show early warning signs (WS)
