 - Empirical
 - Historical (Subject to prosecutor's fallacy)

 - Analytic results
 
## Underlying process

 - Unknown empirical system
 - Empirical system with well-studied model (e.g. Lake)
 - Simulation
   - Saddle node
   - Other - what?
 
## Type of Evidence

 - Variance
 - Autocorrelation
 - Other statistical measure
 - Statistical model fit (e.g., diffusion-jump)
 - Mechanistic model fit (e.g., saddle-node)

## Level of evidence

 - Single instances
 - Statistically robust

## Type of results

 - Shows early warning signals prior to transitions
 - Shows appearance of EWS without a critical transition
 - Shows no EWS prior to critical transition of some kind
